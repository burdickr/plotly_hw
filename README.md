# Belly Button Biodiversity
* Interact with the data by visiting [Belly Button Biodiversity App](https://ryans-plotly.herokuapp.com/).


* In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Step 1 - Plotly.js

I used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for my dashboard. 

* Create a PIE chart that uses data from samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.

* Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.



* Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`

  * Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page

* Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

## Advanced Challenge Assignment 

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the Weekly Washing Frequency obtained from the route `/wfreq/<sample>`

* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected
